# ft_containers

In this project, I am implementing the various container types of the C++ standard template library.  
The namespace will always be ft.  
As a reminder, all of the containers are coded in C++98, so any new feature of the containers ARE NOT
implemented, but every old feature (even deprecated) is present.


### NOTES:
  - implemented containers: ```vector, stack, map.```
  - iterators_traits, reverse_iterator, enable_if, is_integral, equal/lexicographical com-
pare, std::pair, std::make_pair, are re-implemented.


### - Observations :
